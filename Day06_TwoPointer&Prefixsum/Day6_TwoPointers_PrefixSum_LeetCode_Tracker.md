# 📘 Day 6: Two Pointers + Prefix Sum

> 🚀 **Two Pointers** help with linear-time solutions for sorted arrays, window-based problems, and linked lists.  
> ✍️ **Prefix Sum** helps reduce time complexity for range-sum or frequency-based subarray problems.

💡 **Pro Tip:**  
- In Two Pointers, look for *sorted arrays*, *palindromes*, or *sliding windows*.  
- In Prefix Sum, problems often mention *“sum in range”, “number of subarrays”, or “count subarrays with X sum”*.
